        This specification defines an API allowing web pages and [=installed
        web applications=] to set a badge on the document, or an
        application-wide badge, shown in an operating-system-specific place
        associated with the application (such as the shelf or home screen), for
        the purpose of notifying the user when the state of the page or
        application has changed (e.g., when new messages have arrived), without
        showing a more heavyweight notification.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>
        This is an early draft of the Badging API spec.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>
        Usage examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following example shows how an email application might set a badge
        showing the unread count associated with the current document, which is
        updated whenever the client polls for mail from the server.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title=
      "Showing unread count for this document">
        function pollForMail() {
          // ... Fetch unread mail from server. ...

          // Set the document badge. If getUnreadCount() returns 0, this is
          // equivalent to navigator.clearClientBadge().
          navigator.setClientBadge(getUnreadCount());
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The next example shows how a game might show when it is the player's
        turn. Again, this associates the badge with the current document.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title=
      "Showing ready status for this document">
        function showPlayerTurn(playerTurnId) {
          if (playerTurnId === localPlayerId)
            navigator.setClientBadge();
          else
            navigator.clearClientBadge();
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        A separate set of methods set the badge on the [=installed web
        application=], if any, whose [=manifest/navigation scope=] this
        document is within. The badge might show up on the application's icon
        in the operating system shelf. These examples work the same as above,
        except that the badge has global scope (if multiple documents within
        the same application set or clear a badge, the most recent one takes
        effect), and can continue being seen even after the last document
        closes.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title=
      "Showing unread count on the app icon">
        function pollForMail() {
          // ... Fetch unread mail from server. ...

          // Set the app badge.
          navigator.setAppBadge(getUnreadCount());
        }
      </pre>
      <pre class="example javascript" title=
      "Showing ready status on the app icon">
        function showPlayerTurn(playerTurnId) {
          if (playerTurnId === localPlayerId)
            navigator.setAppBadge();
          else
            navigator.clearAppBadge();
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        To show a badge on both the document(s) and app icon(s), use both APIs
        together.

      <h2>
        Badge model
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>badge</dfn> may be one of the following values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The special value <dfn>nothing</dfn>, which indicates that there is
        no badge currently set.
        </li>
        <li>The special value <dfn>flag</dfn>, which indicates that the badge
        is set, but contains no specific data.
        </li>
        <li>An {{unsigned long long}} value, which MUST NOT be 0.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each [=document=] and each [=installed web application=] is associated
        with a <a>badge</a> value, which is initialized to <a>nothing</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY reset an application's badge to <a>nothing</a> at
        its discretion (for example, when the system is restarted).
      </p>
      <p>
        If a <a>badge</a> is <a>nothing</a>, it is said to be
        "<dfn data-local-lt="clearing">cleared</dfn>". Otherwise, it is said to
        be "<dfn>set</dfn>".
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>
        Badge display
      </h2>
      <p>
        When a document's badge is <a>set</a>, if the document's [=browsing
        context=] is a [=top-level browsing context=], the user agent SHOULD
        display the document's badge value alongside the other identifying
        information for that document (for example, on top of the document's
        icon or near its title).
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The user agent is not expected to display a badge associated with a
        document that is not a [=top-level browsing context=], although it is
        allowed to. A user agent does not need to store the badge for a
        non-top-level browsing context if it does not intend to display it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the application's badge is <a>set</a>, the user agent SHOULD
        display the application's badge alongside any symbolic representations
        of the application in the user's operating system (for example, as a
        small overlay on top of the application's icon).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the badge is set to special value <a>flag</a>, the user agent SHOULD
        show an indicator with a non-specific symbol (such as a coloured
        circle).
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY simplify or degrade the data in any way. For
        example, a large integer may be saturated (for example, as "99+"). The
        font and formatting are entirely at the user agent's discretion. The
        user agent MAY ignore the data, and merely show a marker when the
        status is <a>set</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When presenting a badge, it SHOULD be formatted according to the user's
        <a data-cite="ltli/#locale">locale</a> settings. For example, the badge
        content '7' should be displayed as '7' in the <a data-cite=
        "ltli/#locale">locale</a> 'en-NZ' but as 'Ù§' in 'ar-EG'.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Extensions to the `Navigator` and `WorkerNavigator` interfaces
      </h2>
      <p>
        The {{Navigator}} and {{WorkerNavigator}} interfaces are extended with
        methods for setting and [=clearing=] both the document and application
        badge indicators from documents and service workers, respectively.
      </p>
      <pre class="idl">
        [SecureContext]
        partial interface Navigator {
          Promise&lt;undefined&gt; setClientBadge(optional [EnforceRange] unsigned long long contents);

        Navigator includes NavigatorBadge;
        WorkerNavigator includes NavigatorBadge;
      </pre>
      <p>
        User agents that never display document badges SHOULD NOT expose the
        {{Navigator/setClientBadge()}} and {{Navigator/clearClientBadge()}}
        methods. Similarly, user agents that never display application badges
        SHOULD NOT expose the {{NavigatorBadge/setAppBadge()}} and
        {{NavigatorBadge/clearAppBadge()}} methods.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This is important as a feature-detection mechanism to allow sites to
        determine whether setting a badge will have any effect, based on the
        presence of the methods. In particular, sites can use the absence of
        {{Navigator/setClientBadge()}} as a condition for displaying a fallback
        badge in the page's [^title^] or link type "icon".
