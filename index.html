        This specification defines an API that allows [=installed web

        application dock.

      <p>
        A <dfn>badge</dfn> is intended as a mechanism for [=installed web
        applications=] to notify the user that there is some new activity that
        might require their attention, or as a way of indicating a small amount
        of information, such as an unread count.
      </p>
      <p>
        A [=badge=] can have one of the following <dfn data-dfn-for=
        "badge">values</dfn>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          The special value <dfn>"nothing"</dfn>:

          The special value <dfn>"flag"</dfn>:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates that the badge is [=badge/set=], but contains no specific
          value.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          A <dfn>number</dfn> value:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates that the badge is [=badge/set=] to a numerical value
          greater than `0`.

      </dl>
      <p>
        An [=installed web application=] has an associated [=badge=], which is
        initialized to [="nothing"=].
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY (re)[=set=] an application's badge to [="nothing"=]
        at its discretion (for example, following system conventions).

        Displaying a badge

      <p>
        When the application's badge is <dfn data-dfn-for="badge" data-lt=

        display the application's [=badge=] alongside the primary iconic
        representation of the application in the user's operating system (for
        example, as a small overlay on top of the application's icon on the
        home screen on a device).

      <p data-cite="permissions notifications">
        A user agent MAY require [=express permission=] from the user to
        [=badge/set=] the badge. When a user agent requires such
        [=permission=], it SHOULD tie the permission grant to the
        "[=notifications=]" permission.

      <p>
        When the [=badge=] is [=badge/set=] to [="flag"=], the [=user agent=]
        or operating system SHOULD display an indicator with a non-specific
        symbol (for example, a colored circle).
      </p>
      <p>
        When a [=badge=]'s value is [=badge/set=] to [="nothing"=], the [=user

        <li>SHOULD format and display the number according to the user's font
        and formatting preferences. For example, as a number in a circle on top
        of the application's icon on the home screen on a device.
        </li>
        <li>MAY simplify or degrade a badge's [=number=] [=badge/value=] in any
        way that matches the platform's conventions for representing numbers in
        a badge. For example, a platform might choose to display a badge with a
        value of '100' as '99+'.
        </li>
        <li>SHOULD localize the number according to the user's locale
        preferences. For example, the [=badge/value=] '7' should be displayed
        as '7' in the locale 'en' (English) but as '٧' in 'ar' (Arabic).

        <li>MAY treat a [=number=] [=badge/value=] as [="flag"=], or whatever

        The API is write-only by design. There is no way for a site to read
