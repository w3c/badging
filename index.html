        This specification defines an API that allows [=installed web
        applications=] to set an application badge, which is usually shown
        alongside the application's icon on the device's home screen or
        application dock.

      Responsible badge usage
    </h2>
    <p>
      Badges can contribute to notification fatigue for some users. As such,
      authors need to reserve badges for states that truly merit user attention
      or action; avoid using them for marketing or engagement gimmicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid rapidly changing values that increase distraction or cognitive
      load.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support users who do not perceive badges, or have disabled them at the
      system level, authors are encouraged to present the same state within
      application UI using accessible patterns (e.g., clearly labeled in-app
      status indicators).

          // Try to set the app badge.
          try {
            await navigator.setAppBadge(unreadCount);

        Model

      <p>
        A <dfn>badge</dfn> is intended as a mechanism for [=installed web
        applications=] to notify the user that there is some new activity that
        might require their attention, or as a way of indicating a small amount
        of information, such as an unread count.
      </p>
      <p>
        A [=badge=] can have one of the following <dfn class="export"
        data-dfn-for="badge">values</dfn>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          The special value <dfn class="export" data-dfn-for=
          "badge">"nothing"</dfn>:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates that there is no badge currently [=badge/set=].
        </dd>
        <dt>
          The special value <dfn class="export" data-dfn-for=
          "badge">"flag"</dfn>:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates that the badge is [=badge/set=], but contains no specific
          value.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          A <dfn class="export" data-dfn-for="badge">number</dfn> value:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Indicates that the badge is [=badge/set=] to a numerical value
          greater than `0`.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        An [=installed web application=] has an associated [=badge=], which is
        initialized to [=badge/"nothing"=]. The operating system stores and
        manages the badge value, with the [=user agent=] acting as an
        intermediary to communicate badge changes to the OS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY (re)[=set=] an application's badge to
        [=badge/"nothing"=] at its discretion (for example, following system
        conventions).

        Displaying a badge

      <p>
        When the application's badge is <dfn data-dfn-for="badge" data-lt=

        display the application's [=badge=] alongside the primary iconic
        representation of the application in the user's operating system (for

      <p data-cite="permissions notifications">
        A user agent MAY require [=express permission=] from the user to

      <p>

        displaying it.

        agent=] or operating system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>SHOULD format and display the number according to the user's font
        and formatting preferences. For example, as a number in a circle on top
        of the application's icon on the home screen on a device.
        </li>
        <li>MAY simplify or degrade a badge's [=badge/number=] [=badge/value=]
        in any way that matches the platform's conventions for representing
        numbers in a badge. For example, a platform might choose to display a
        badge with a value of '100' as '99+'.
        </li>
        <li>SHOULD localize the number according to the user's locale
        preferences. For example, the [=badge/value=] '7' should be displayed
        as '7' in the locale 'en' (English) but as '٧' in 'ar' (Arabic).

        <li>MAY treat a [=badge/number=] [=badge/value=] as [=badge/"flag"=],

        Privacy considerations

      <p>
        The API is write-only by design. There is no way for a site to read
        back the value of a badge that was previously set, to ensure that the
        application badge cannot be used as a storage or fingerprinting
        mechanism.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>
        Security considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The [=user agent=] or operating system MAY [=badge/clear=] a [=badge=]
        at its discretion, and to follow any system conventions (for example,
        when the system is reset).
      </p>
      <p>
        User agents MAY rate-limit badge [=set the application badge|setting=]
        or [=badge/clear|clearing=] the application badge to prevent
        distracting animations and reduce resource usage. However, user agents
        SHOULD generally leave rate limiting to the operating system, as it is
        in a better position to determine appropriate throttling based on
        system load, user preferences, and accessibility considerations.
      </p>
    </section>
    <h2>
      Accessibility considerations
    </h2>
    <p>
      Application badges convey status that can require the user's attention.
      Because badges are often presented outside the web content area (for
      example, on an app icon in the dock), user agents need to ensure that the
      information remains accessible and controllable through platform
      accessibility features and user preferences.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Screen reader compatibility
    </h3>
    <p>
      User agents SHOULD expose the current [=badge/value=] (including
      [=badge/"flag"=] vs. [=badge/number=]) through platform accessibility
      APIs so that assistive technologies can present it on demand (for
      example, when the user focuses the application icon).
    </p>
    <p>
      User agents <em>SHOULD NOT</em> automatically announce badge changes;
      instead, they SHOULD follow platform conventions that avoid unsolicited
      interruptions.
    </p>
    <h3 class="informative">
      Visual accessibility
    </h3>
    <p>
      As badges are typically drawn by the underlying platform, visual
      affordances are typically handled there. Nevertheless, user agents and
      platforms need to consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning (provide text or an
      accessible name).
      </li>
      <li>Ensure sufficient non-text contrast between badge glyph and
      background.
      </li>
      <li>Use sizing that remains legible across system font/scale settings.
      </li>
      <li>Honor high-contrast / forced-colors and dark mode preferences where
      applicable.
      </li>
      <li>If animating badge changes, honor reduced-motion preferences and
      avoid flashing effects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Platform integration and user preferences
    </h3>
    <p>
      User agents SHOULD integrate with platform accessibility settings and
      themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      User agents SHOULD reflect OS-level per-application badge preferences
      (for example, when the operating system disables badges for an app).
